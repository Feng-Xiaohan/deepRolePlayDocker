# DeepRolePlay: Deep Role-Playing System Based on Multi-Agent Architecture

English | [‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

## Project Overview

DeepRolePlay is a groundbreaking multi-agent role-playing system that completely solves the character forgetting problem of traditional large language models through Agent collaboration mechanisms.

DeepRolePlay adopts a multi-agent division of labor architecture: **Memory Flashback Agent** + **Scenario Update Agent** + **Main Conversation Model**, enabling AI to bid farewell to character forgetting and achieve truly coherent role-playing.

### üò§ Have You Ever Encountered These Problems?
- ü§ñ **AI Suddenly Forgets Character Settings**: A mage suddenly picks up a sword
- üìñ **Inconsistent Plot**: Important plots from yesterday are completely forgotten today
- üí∏ **Huge Token Consumption**: Long conversation costs skyrocket, experience interrupted

### ‚úÖ DeepRolePlay's Solutions
- üß† **Never Forget**: Agent automatically maintains character memory, settings permanently preserved
- üîÑ **Plot Coherence**: Intelligent scenario updates, logical clarity even after millions of conversation rounds
- üí∞ **Cost Control**: Scenario compression technology, long conversation costs reduced by 80%
- üìö **Intelligent Internet Access**: Integrated Wikipedia, free automatic completion of character backgrounds and story settings
- ‚ö° **Plug and Play**: 5-minute integration, direct use with SillyTavern and other platforms
- üöÄ **Ultra-Fast Response**: Using Gemini 2.5 Flash intelligent agents, only 20-30 seconds longer than normal responses


## üéØ How to Use

### üíæ Quick Start - Ready-to-Use Version

1. **üì¶ Extract Software Package**
   - Download the released software package and extract it to a **non-Chinese path**
   - The extracted folder contains: `config.yaml` configuration file + `DeepRolePlay.exe` main program

2. **‚öôÔ∏è Modify Configuration File**
   
   Edit the `config.yaml` file, **Gemini 2.5 Flash is strongly recommended for intelligent agents (only 20 seconds longer response than normal)**:

   ```yaml
   # API Proxy Configuration - Forwarding Target
   proxy:
     target_url: "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"                      # Your forwarding API address, DeepSeek recommended
     timeout: 60                                                     # Recommended 60 seconds
   
   # Agent Configuration - Model used by Agent (Must be Gemini 2.5 Flash)
   agent:
     model: "gemini-2.5-flash"                                       # Strongly recommended: Gemini 2.5 Flash
     base_url: "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta"   # Gemini API address
     api_key: "your-gemini-api-key"                                  # Your Gemini API Key
     temperature: 0.7
     max_iterations: 25
   
   # Server Configuration
   server:
     host: "0.0.0.0"
     port: 6666                                                      # Remember this port number
   ```

3. **üöÄ Start Program**
   - Double-click `DeepRolePlay.exe` to start
   - Wait for "Service Started" prompt

4. **üîó Configure Role-Playing Frontend**
   - In platforms like SillyTavern, OpenWebUI
   - Change `base_url` to: `http://localhost:6666/v1`
   - Keep API Key unchanged (will be automatically forwarded)
   - **Important**: Disable history record limits, must send full history to proxy! (Don't worry about token explosion, max_history_length will control it)

5. **üé≠ Start Role-Playing**
   - Immediately enjoy forgetting-free role-playing experience!

### üîß Compatibility Description
- ‚úÖ **Fully Compatible with OpenAI API Format**: All tools supporting OpenAI can be used directly
- ‚úÖ **Support Mainstream Models**: Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, local Ollama, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Dual Configuration**: Agent and forwarding target can use different models, flexible cost optimization

## Agent Working Principle

Traditional single model problem: **Character Forgetting** ‚Üí **Plot Breakdown** ‚Üí **Experience Collapse**

DeepRolePlay's Agent Solution:
- üîç **Memory Flashback Agent**: Intelligently retrieves historical conversations and external knowledge
- üìù **Scenario Update Agent**: Real-time maintenance of character state and plot coherence
- üé≠ **Main Conversation Model**: Generates character responses based on complete context

## Developer Guide

### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.12
- UV Virtual Environment Manager (Recommended)

### 1. Install Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepRolePlay.git
cd deepRolePlay
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Service

Edit `config/config.yaml` file, **Gemini 2.5 Flash is recommended (fast response)**:

```yaml
# API Proxy Configuration - Forwarding Target
proxy:
  target_url: "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"                      # Your forwarding API address
  timeout: 60                                                     # Request timeout (seconds)

# Agent Configuration - Model used by Agent (Must be Gemini 2.5 Flash)
agent:
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash"                                       # Must use Gemini 2.5 Flash
  base_url: "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta"   # Gemini API address
  api_key: "your-gemini-api-key"                                  # Your Gemini API Key
  temperature: 0.7                                                # Generation temperature (0-1)
  max_iterations: 25                                              # Maximum iterations

# Scenario Management
scenario:
  file_path: "./scenarios/scenario.txt"      # Scenario file path
  update_enabled: true                        # Whether to enable automatic updates

# Server Configuration
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 6666
```

### 3. Start Service

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

### 4. Integration and Usage

Change your AI application's (SillyTavern, OpenWebUI, etc.) API endpoint to:
```
http://localhost:6666/v1
```

The system will automatically:
1. Intercept conversation requests
2. Execute agent workflow
3. Update scenario state
4. Inject enhanced context into requests
5. Return more accurate role-playing responses

### 5. Package for Distribution

Use PyInstaller to package as executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --name DeepRolePlay --onefile --clean --console --add-data "src;src" --add-data "utils;utils" main.py
```

After packaging, `DeepRolePlay.exe` will be generated in the `dist/` directory, distribute it together with the configuration file to users.

## Supported Models

### üîå Full Compatibility with OpenAI Format API
This project uses standard OpenAI API format, supporting all compatible service providers:

- **üåü Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Strongly Recommended): Fastest speed, only adds 20 seconds response time, excellent role-playing effects
- **üí∞ DeepSeek**: Best cost-performance, low cost
- **üíª Local Ollama**: Fully private deployment, data security

### ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI Official API Not Recommended
Although fully compatible with OpenAI format, **using OpenAI official service is not recommended**:
- üîí **Excessive Safety Policies**: Strict restrictions on role-playing content, affecting experience
